# SecureJwTeaTime

SecureTeaTime is a simple API built with Spring Security to demonstrate the use of JWT tokens for securing endpoints. 
This project serves as a personal Spring Security template, designed to be a starting point for building secured applications. 
The main goal is to provide a foundation for security configuration that I can build and improve on over time, adding more features as I continue learning.
